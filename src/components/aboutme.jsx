      <p>
      I am a versatile and passionate developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and Modern JavaScript, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive web applications. My experience with the Django framework allows me to build robust backends, while my knowledge of SQL databases ensures efficient data management. I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. My proficiency with Unity Engine showcases my ability to develop interactive experiences and games. Additionally, Iâ€™m skilled in AWS for cloud services, Three.js for 3D web development, and WordPress for content management systems. With a strong foundation in Python and C++, I excel in both scripting and software development. Whether it's building scalable backend systems, designing engaging user interfaces, or working on complex algorithms, I am always eager to contribute and grow in a dynamic development environment.
